# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The basic website is a simplified reference guide for new coding bootcampstudents.  
It was created not only to visualize some notes of what a student learns but to also help the student who learned to build it.
As an upcoming coding student, we followed step by step process to create this webpage.
The layout is utilitarian but exciting. To see a project come together is inspiring. That is why I joined this class.  
We have learned, CLI's, Git and Github, some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript commands.
